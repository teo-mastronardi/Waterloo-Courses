Hello, World! Welcome to CS 136!

These are some facts obtained from
https://www.allaboutbirds.org
about the 'Branta Canadensis'
(known to his friends as "Mr. Goose").

Their length ranges from 76 to 110cm,
which is approximately 60% of their
large wingspan. They can weigh up to 9kg.

They mate for life with very low "divorce rates"
and mate "assortatively", meaning larger birds
choose larger mates and the same for smaller ones.

We hope you've enjoyed these fun geese facts on A1.
