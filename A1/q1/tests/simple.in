In case you're curious, it does not matter
what is in this simple.in file, because your
program will not read from input.

But the [I/O TEST] button requires that a
simple.in file exists to test your simple.expect file.

For this question we're only concerned that
your code produces the output contained in
simple.expect *exactly*.
