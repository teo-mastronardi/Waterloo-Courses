;; ///////////////////////////////////////////////////

;; (robot pos direct dist) consumes a position
;;  (pos), a direction (direct) and a distance (dist)
;;    to produce a new position for the robot after moving
;;     the given distance and given direction from its current
;;      position.

;; robot: Posn Sym Nat -> Make-Posn

;;Examples:
(check-expect (robot (make-posn 0 0) 'north 2) (make-posn 0 2))
(check-expect (robot (make-posn 0 0) 'north 2) (make-posn 0 2))

(define (robot pos direc dist)
  (cond
    [(symbol=? direc 'north)
     (make-posn (posn-x pos)(+ (posn-y pos) dist))]
    [(symbol=? direc 'east)
     (make-posn (posn-y pos)(+ (posn-x pos) dist))]
    [(symbol=? direc 'west)
     (make-posn (posn-x pos)(- (posn-y pos) dist))]
    [(symbol=? direc 'south)
     (make-posn (posn-y pos)(- (posn-x pos) dist))]))


;;Tests
(check-expect (robot (make-posn 0 2) 'north 3) (make-posn 0 5))
(check-expect (robot (make-posn 3 2) 'south 1) (make-posn 2 2))
(check-expect (robot (make-posn 2 1) 'west 2) (make-posn 2 -1))
(check-expect (robot (make-posn 1 2) 'east 1) (make-posn 2 2))
